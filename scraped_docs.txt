The partnership with the squad dates back to 2005 (when the team was racing as Davitamon-Lotto) and had been set to expire following the 2022 season. “I am extremely proud that we will continue to work with Ridley in the coming years. As a Belgian company that focuses on innovation, quality, and performance, it is a perfect match with what Lotto Soudal stands for. Just like us, Ridley has the passion to take Belgian cycling to an even higher level. This has already been expressed in the many successes that we have achieved in a partnership of almost fifteen years,” said Lotto-Soudal general manager John Lelangue. For the 2022 season, Lotto Soudal will race on the Noah Fast Disc, the Helium SLX Disc, and the new Dean Fast Disc time trial bike. Equipment partners Selle Italia, Deda, Lizard Skins, Look, and Vittoria will remain on board next, year, however, effective immediately, team issue bikes will be built with DT Swiss wheels, KMC chains, and Shimano Dura-Ace groups with CEMA bearings. Lotto-Soudal sprint ace Caleb Ewan expressed enthusiasm about the partnership extension. “For three seasons, my Ridley Noah Fast Disc and I took part in the most important competitions in the world. And I can safely say that it has been a winning combination. And why tinker with a winning team?” Ewan said. “That’s why I’m very happy that we will continue to work with Ridley in the coming seasons. It’s amazing to be able to rely on their extensive expertise. “I can’t wait to see what the next few years will bring. I am sure we will create many more great memories together,” Ewan added. Strava adds more control to feed and tracks Local Legends in Zwift segments Checking the Mute Activity box will keep an activity from others’ feeds, but won’t affect your achievements. Strava will now track Local Legends for specific segments in Zwift. Strava pushed new updates for users Tuesday which makes for an uncluttered activity feed, and also more fun for competing for Local Legends in Zwift. All athletes using mobile app version 220 or later can now mute activities so that the individual Strava records will count towards challenges, or Local Legends on segments, without a specific activity appearing in friends’ or clubs’ feeds. So a commute, for example, will still check the box for a Local Legend on a specific segment, but now show up in the scrolling list of activities that all followers can view. Another update Strava made is adding Local Legends to select Zwift segments. Local Legends for specific segments are refreshed on a rolling 90-day period. Zwift already supports speed-ranked achievements (e.g., KOMs and QOMs) and with the addition of Local Legends for more than 20 segments across its virtual worlds, users can find new and different ways to compete virtually with each other.

All rights reserved The BPSA reached out to industry suppliers in late spring following the widespread awareness of a quick release lever issue earlier this year after Trek\'s recall of nearly 1 million bikes. That recall involved quick releases whose levers are left open or improperly adjusted while riding and can be caught in the front disc brake rotor when in the open position. This type of quick release is widely spec\'d among bike suppliers. This is the largest group recall the industry has acted on, said Ray Keener, the BPSA\'s executive director. Constantine said that companies participating in this group recall are shipping replacement QRs to retailers. Compensation for the labor is being handled differently by each company and retailers should refer to each company\'s individual website for more details about logging their recall activities, replacement QRs and disposing of affected QR mechanisms. BPSA\'s Keener said the marketing materials and informational posters, video and website were included in the overall cost for suppliers to be part of the group, and shared among all.

Companies that are part of this recall are Accell North America (Raleigh, Diamondback), Advanced Sports International (Breezer, Fuji, SE), Cycling Sports Group (Cannondale, GT), Felt, G.Joanou Cycle Co. (Jamis), Giant Bicycle, Haro, LTP Sports Group (Norco), Performance Bicycle (Access), Quality Bicycle Products (Civia Cycles), Recreational Equipment Inc. (Novara), Ridley Bikes and Specialized Bicycle Components. Specific models for each company weren\'t named in the recall notice, but bikes affected date back as far as 1998 for some brands. The bikes sold for between $200 and $10,000. According to the CPSC recall notice, about 1.5 million bikes are affected. Three incidents were reported in which riders were injured as a result of an open quick release lever on the front wheel coming in contact with the front disc brake. One resulted in a broken finger, wrist injury, shoulder injury and abrasions; no injuries were reported in the other two incidents. As part of the group recall, the BPSA has created a number of resources for consumers and retailers. A central website, quickreleaserecall.com, is now live. It addresses questions and directs consumers and retailers to appropriate resources. Among the resources is a video (below) that shows consumers how to check to see if their bike is among those affected. Consumers are being told to check their bike and see if the quick release is part of the recall. They can do this by applying the #2 pencil test. This involves opening the lever and loosening the front-wheel quick-release cam, pushing the lever toward the brake disc rotor, and measuring the distance between the cam lever and the rotor. If the distance is more than a quarter of an inch (6 millimeters), the QR is not affected by this recall. This can be checked by sliding an ordinary #2 pencil between the cam lever and the rotor. If the pencil cannot easily fit between the lever and disc rotor, consumers must take their bikes to their local shop for a replacement QR. Constantine said that companies participating in this group recall are shipping replacement QRs to retailers. Compensation for the labor is being handled differently by each company and retailers should refer to each company\'s individual website for more details about logging their recall activities, replacement QRs and disposing of affected QR mechanisms. BPSA also has created QR Safety Recall posters (attached below) that it is mailing out to more than 5,000 retailers for posting in visible areas in their service departments until Jan. 31, 2016, along with a letter that explains the QR lever recall and where to go for more information. BPSA\'s Keener said the marketing materials and informational posters, video and website were included in the overall cost for suppliers to be part of the group, and shared among all. "It\'s very similar to what we do with the Owner\'s Manual," Keener said. "If individual companies did it on their own, they would be spending more money to make their own poster, video, etc. This is what the BPSA is all about — cooperation for the greater good." Pat Cunnane, chair of the BPSA\'s committee addressing the matter, said, "Rider safety is our top priority." "We are pleased to be able to serve a role in bringing together the participating companies and facilitating this unprecedented large group effort," he added. Ridley Bikes\' Richard Wittenberg said the company only had 18 bikes affected by this recall. "We\'re the smallest company that joined the group, but we\'re committed to cycling safety no matter what. And if there\'s one bike affected by this, we\'re doing it. It\'s not acceptable to have anything that can possibly hurt anybody out in the field," Wittenberg said.

In the space of a few years, Ridley became the largest bike producer in Belgium and an innovative force within the cycling industry. Its first major development was the conical headset, which featured on its 2001 Ridley Damocles bike. Highlights: The Bike Valley facility - an innovation centre that contained a wind tunnel and heat chamber - opened next door to the Ridley factory in 2013. At this point in time, Ridley also returned to its family roots, with Aerts becoming sole owner of the company once again. In early 2023, Ridley’s Grifn all-terrain bike was awarded the Design & Innovation Award. Ridley is the largest bicycle manufacturer in Belgium and produces bikes for various cycling disciplines but specialises in aerodynamically-focused road and gravel bikes. Current sponsorships: Lotto Dstny, Pauwels Sauzen-Bingoal VAT No. The Belgian company’s name has a rather unusual origin and it stems from the founder’s love for films. Aerts idolised film director Ridley Scott, the man behind films such as Alien and Blade Runner. However, with Scott already in use as a well-established Swiss bike brand, Ridley was the next choice.

After decades of opposing sports wagering, the league has now signed major sponsorship deals with casinos, the Raiders play their home games in Las Vegas, and the draft will be held there in April — and the Super Bowl in 2024. AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTSupported bySKIP ADVERTISEMENTN.F.L. Hands Calvin Ridley a 1-Year Suspension for Betting on GamesThe league said Ridley, a receiver for the Atlanta Falcons, bet on games in November while he was on leave from the team to address a mental health issue.Share full articleCalvin Ridley played five games for the Atlanta Falcons during the 2021 season.Credit...Seth Wenig/Associated PressBy Ken BelsonMarch 7, 2022Atlanta Falcons receiver Calvin Ridley was suspended for at least the entire 2022 season for gambling on N.F.L. games last year, one of the harshest penalties a major American sports league has doled out since the N.F.L. rushed to embrace an expansion of legalized wagering on games.Commissioner Roger Goodell said in a statement on Monday that Ridley, 27, placed bets on N.F.L. games during a five-day period in late November 2021 when he was away from the club to focus on his mental health.After an investigation, the league “uncovered no evidence indicating any inside information was used or that any game was compromised in any way,” Goodell said in the statement. “Nor was there evidence suggesting any awareness by coaches, staff, teammates, or other players of his betting activity.”Still, Goodell said the “integrity of the game” is fundamental to the league’s success, and Ridley put that integrity at risk.Ridley placed three parlay bets between Nov. 23 and Nov. 28 on the Hard Rock Sportsbook mobile app while he was in Florida, according to a person with knowledge of the matter who was not authorized to speak publicly. Genius Sports, which monitors sports betting data for the league, alerted the N.F.L. that a player might be behind those bets. The N.F.L.’s investigation found that Ridley’s bets included a wager on the Falcons to win.Soon after the N.F.L. announced the suspension, Ridley wrote on Twitter: “I bet 1500 total I don’t have a gambling problem,” later adding that he couldn’t watch football at that point.He then posted: “I know I was wrong But I’m getting 1 year lol.”Ridley’s agent, Ben Setas, did not immediately return requests for comment on Monday.Ridley announced on Oct. 31, 2021, that he would step away from the team because of a mental health issue.“These past few weeks have been very challenging and as much as I’d like to be on the field competing with my teammates, I need to step away from football at this time and focus on my mental well-being,” Ridley said in a statement posted to his social media accounts. “This will help me be the best version of myself now and in the future.A four-year N.F.L. veteran, Ridley had his best season in 2020 when he caught 90 passes for 1,374 yards. Last season, he played in just five games. The team exercised his fifth-year option for the 2022 season last spring.The Falcons said in a statement that they first learned on the league’s investigation on Feb. 9, and that they “support the league’s findings and actions.”Ridley can appeal his suspension within three days and ask to be reinstated on or after Feb. 15, 2023.Ridley’s suspension is the first sports gambling-related penalty the N.F.L. has imposed on a player since 2019, when it suspended Arizona Cardinals defensive back Josh Shaw for the remainder of that season. Shaw, who was on the injured reserved list at the time, was suspended for the remainder of the 2019 season as well as the 2020 season. He has not played in the N.F.L. since.Before Shaw’s suspension, the N.F.L. had not penalized a player for gambling on games in more than two decades.The most well-known punishments for sports gambling-related infractions in the N.F.L. occurred in 1963 when Pete Rozelle, who was then the commissioner, suspended Green Bay Packers running back Paul Hornung and Detroit Lions defensive end Alex Karras for the entire season for betting on football games.In 1946, the day before the N.F.L.’s championship game between the Chicago Bears and the Giants, the league’s commissioner, Bert Bell, was told by the assistant district attorney in Manhattan that Giants quarterback Frank Filchock and running back Merle Hapes had been offered $2,500 to throw the game.Bell said that the police found that the players had not taken any bribes, and so allowed Filchock — who had denied being approached by gamblers — to play.

Order Reprints | Today’s Paper | SubscribeShare full articleAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT Atlanta Falcons receiver Calvin Ridley was suspended for at least the entire 2022 season for gambling on N.F.L. games last year, one of the harshest penalties a major American sports league has doled out since the N.F.L. rushed to embrace an expansion of legalized wagering on games.Commissioner Roger Goodell said in a statement on Monday that Ridley, 27, placed bets on N.F.L. games during a five-day period in late November 2021 when he was away from the club to focus on his mental health.After an investigation, the league “uncovered no evidence indicating any inside information was used or that any game was compromised in any way,” Goodell said in the statement. “Nor was there evidence suggesting any awareness by coaches, staff, teammates, or other players of his betting activity.”Still, Goodell said the “integrity of the game” is fundamental to the league’s success, and Ridley put that integrity at risk.Ridley placed three parlay bets between Nov. 23 and Nov. 28 on the Hard Rock Sportsbook mobile app while he was in Florida, according to a person with knowledge of the matter who was not authorized to speak publicly. Genius Sports, which monitors sports betting data for the league, alerted the N.F.L. that a player might be behind those bets. The N.F.L.’s investigation found that Ridley’s bets included a wager on the Falcons to win.Soon after the N.F.L. announced the suspension, Ridley wrote on Twitter: “I bet 1500 total I don’t have a gambling problem,” later adding that he couldn’t watch football at that point.He then posted: “I know I was wrong But I’m getting 1 year lol.”Ridley’s agent, Ben Setas, did not immediately return requests for comment on Monday.Ridley announced on Oct. 31, 2021, that he would step away from the team because of a mental health issue.“These past few weeks have been very challenging and as much as I’d like to be on the field competing with my teammates, I need to step away from football at this time and focus on my mental well-being,” Ridley said in a statement posted to his social media accounts. “This will help me be the best version of myself now and in the future.A four-year N.F.L. veteran, Ridley had his best season in 2020 when he caught 90 passes for 1,374 yards. Last season, he played in just five games. The team exercised his fifth-year option for the 2022 season last spring.The Falcons said in a statement that they first learned on the league’s investigation on Feb. 9, and that they “support the league’s findings and actions.”Ridley can appeal his suspension within three days and ask to be reinstated on or after Feb. 15, 2023.Ridley’s suspension is the first sports gambling-related penalty the N.F.L. has imposed on a player since 2019, when it suspended Arizona Cardinals defensive back Josh Shaw for the remainder of that season. Shaw, who was on the injured reserved list at the time, was suspended for the remainder of the 2019 season as well as the 2020 season. He has not played in the N.F.L. since.Before Shaw’s suspension, the N.F.L. had not penalized a player for gambling on games in more than two decades.The most well-known punishments for sports gambling-related infractions in the N.F.L. occurred in 1963 when Pete Rozelle, who was then the commissioner, suspended Green Bay Packers running back Paul Hornung and Detroit Lions defensive end Alex Karras for the entire season for betting on football games.In 1946, the day before the N.F.L.’s championship game between the Chicago Bears and the Giants, the league’s commissioner, Bert Bell, was told by the assistant district attorney in Manhattan that Giants quarterback Frank Filchock and running back Merle Hapes had been offered $2,500 to throw the game.Bell said that the police found that the players had not taken any bribes, and so allowed Filchock — who had denied being approached by gamblers — to play. Bell suspended Hapes, who admitted having been asked to throw the game but did not report it to the league. Filchock later admitted to lying to Bell, and he was suspended indefinitely.
